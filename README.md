# sshbox for amv
This repo contains simple scripts and a gpg encrypted ssh config bundle so that servers can be reached in an emergency from any computer capable of running Docker.

You need the password to open the bundle. The password is comprised of two passwords historically used by amv, first one being the ari one and the next one being the rodent one.
